# Book-Recommendations-System
Build a book recommendation system using NLP

## Project Description

Recommendation systems are at the heart of many products such as Netflix or Amazon. 
They generally rely on metadata (e.g., the actors or director of a movie) or on user tastes (e.g., the movies you liked before) to determine which you are most likely to enjoy. 
But when you are working with text-heavy datasets, you have access to a much richer resourceâ€”the whole text! 
In this project, the basis of a book recommendation system is built based on their content. You will use Charles Darwin's bibliography to find out which books might interest you.

## Project Tasks

    1. Darwin's bibliography
    2. Load the contents of each book into Python
    3. Find "On the Origin of Species"
    4. Tokenize the corpus
    5. Stemming of the tokenized corpus
    6. Building a bag-of-words model
    7. The most common words of a given book
    8. Build a tf-idf model
    9. The results of the tf-idf model
    10. Compute distance between texts
    11. The book most similar to "On the Origin of Species"
    12. Which books have similar content?
